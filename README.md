The code here is pretty much everything I use to create my datasets (from FBRef) or visuals. Most my scatter plots are made in Tableau, though, using the dataset created from the FBRef dataset download.

Feel free to download any of this code and use it yourself, it's on the MIT license. No need to give attribution to me, but any credit or even a tag (@BeGriffis on twitter) is much appreciated! And I'd love to see the work you do with this code, of course ;)

# Intro
The code here is pretty much everything I use to create my datasets (from FBRef) or visuals. Most my scatter plots are made in Tableau, though, using the dataset created from the FBRef dataset download.

Feel free to download any of this code and use it yourself, it's on the MIT license. No need to give attribution to me, but any credit or even a tag (@BeGriffis on twitter) is much appreciated! And I'd love to see the work you do with this code, of course!

# Installing Jupyter Notebook
All of this code is written in Python but using Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook is free and safe, and easy, to install. If you don't have it on your computer yet, there are several ways to get it; I'll give two examples below.

### Project Jupyter
One method is by downloading direct from Project Jupyter: https://jupyter.org/install

Follow the short instructions there to download. You can download and start coding in seconds.

### Anaconda
Another way to get Jupyter Notebook is to install it via Anaconda, which acts as an environment to host much of your coding needs: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

This method is what I use, however there are a couple extra steps to begin working in Jupyter Notebook. But, it is still easy to follow and Anaconda gives good instructions.

# Running These Code Files: No Major Coding Experience Needed!

Once you have Jupyter Notebook, you can begin running these code files.

Download the files from this repository and open them with Jupyter Notebook. The instructions should hopefully be straight forward for all files.

The 1st code file to run is the "Download Top 5 Leagues csv from FBRef .com", as the 2 datasets it creates act as the raw data for the majority of the other files. To run that code, all you need to do is click "Run" in the top bar in Jupyter Notebook. It's that simple!

After you have run that file, you can then start making your own scouting cards and passing style charts.

### Scouting Cards & Passing Style Programs

To create your own reports, you'll need to click in the second block of code (each block has a grey background) and Run that. Then, scroll back to the first block and edit the information. I added notes (after the # in each line) explaining (hopefully easiily) what to do.

Once you've entered your player's info, click Run (or press ctrl+enter on your keyboard) and voil√†, there's your image!
